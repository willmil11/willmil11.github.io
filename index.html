                    So basically i'm a self-taught software engineer 
                    but also a gamer, i like to play games like Minecraft, Fortnite but MOSTLY Zelda breath 
                    of wild, i don't like the new tears of the kingdom tho i prefer breath of the wild for me
                    it's the mvp of the zelda games. I speak english and french, don't like school but still
                    good at it, I don't have many friends and i think that's all about me :)
                </p>
                <h1 id="my-projects" class="title">My projects</h1>
                <p class="text">
                    I have many projects, right now i have a few, here's a little list
                    of them:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li class="text">Easynodes: A node.js module that i published on npm, it's purpose is to make 
                        everything in node.js easy. I consider it completed because it works and it's released but 
                        don't worry updates are still comming :)
                    </li>
                    <li class="text">
                        @willmil11/webserver: A node.js module that i published on npm, probably going to delete it soon engough
                        it's old the name is ugly it doesn't work very very well it just creates the simplest possible http server,
                        i made it when i was still a begginer in node.js DON'T USE IT. I'm going to make a new one soon.
                    </li>
                    <li class="text">
                        OnlineCraft: That's a minecraft copy with different textures and stuff to avoid copyright it's far from
                        completed it doesn't work very well but it has a lot of potential, i'm going to work on it again soon. The
                        url is <a class="link" href="http://89.159.202.47/OnlineCraft/i.html">http://89.159.202.47/OnlineCraft/i.html</a> warning tho: It's in dev and i'm devlopping on production meaning
                        you get the changes as i code them meaning it's really unstable. The thing that is revolutionnary is that you
                        don't NEED to install it it's all in the web but i'll probably make an electron installable version one day.
                    </li>
                    <li class="text">
                        WebCrafty: I'm making a game engine also in the web but i'll probably also create an electron installable
                        version one day. It's basically a game engine for 2D and 3D games, so you can create games and it will 
                        give you an html and js file ready to deploy. At the moment i'm writing this nothing is working i'm still
                        working on the account system but it'll probably be ok soon i don't know if i'll update this portafolio soon
                        so better check if it's ok now: <a class="link" href="http://89.159.202.47/WebCrafty/i.html">http://89.159.202.47/WebCrafty/i.html</a>

                        CoolOS: I'm making an operating system in node.js based on linux, basically it's the most basic 
                        alpine linux that boots up in a node.js os container. Still in devloppement.

                    I'm a self-taught software engineer, i specialised myself in javascript i do frontend and backend, i'm not a
                    stylist but my frontend design are still pretty good i would say, i'm very very good at backend tho i'm a
                    master at node.js i know everything about it, i'm also starting to learn python and it's ok but i don't like it
                    too much. It's good and powerfull but it's not my style.
